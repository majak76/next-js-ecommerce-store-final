    text: "With more than 1000 calories and usually over 45 grams of fat per serving, Luther burger is one of the world's unhealthiest burgers, but its flavors and a unique combination of ingredients make up for it. The standard burger bun is replaced by a sliced, sugar-glazed donut (usually a Krispy Kreme).Aside from that, Luther is basically a cheeseburger topped with bacon, and it is typically served without vegetables or condiments. Many people believe that it was invented at Mulligan's Bar in Georgia, when the cook ran out of standard hamburger buns and used donuts instead.",

    text: 'The Mac & Cheese Burger is a thing of pure insanity. It features a panko-crusted mac & cheese patty, topped with a beef patty, topped with more mac & cheese. The cheese makes the patty hard to find, but once beef meets tongue it is a pure bliss. The bun was shockingly able to hold its own against the deluge of melted cheese, noodles and meat..',

    text: 'Crispy golden brown crust enveloping juicy tender sake flavoured chicken meat between 2 perfectly pan seared brown rice patties just screams Chicken Katsu Burger. The hero of the dish is the rice. The rice should be sticky, chewy and moist enough to form a perfect rice patty without breaking apart when it’s pan seared. We would say brown rice burger patties are the new burger buns.The layers of fragrant rice patty with crispy crunchy katsu burger, tomatoes and lettuce with a generous drizzle of tonkatsu sauce plus furikake topping will please any hungry tummy!

Piled high with creamy peanut butter, extra-crispy bacon, caramelized bananas, and a sweet honey drizzle, this totally unique combination of flavors will have you all shook up. ",

And the burger sounds something straight out of Wonka’s imagination. Served on a rainbow bun, it has a beef patty, tomato soup jelly, fried potatoes, popping cheese, and a secret Wonka sauce.It might not sound like the most appetizing combination of ingredients, but if Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory taught us anything it’s to trust the eccentric genius.',

Guys, this is crazy good. Trust me. You'll love it. So maybe we can't solve all the world's problems with a backyard barbecue, but it's not the worst place to start.

He then takes two freshly made buns and deep-fries them to golden perfection. After that, he cooks two pieces of bacon until they're perfectly crispy. Add some American cheese with the nutella creme on the burger, let it melt, and voilà!",

It's no surprise that this burger ended up causing some controversy when it came out due to its religious connections, but we don't think religion should have to be kept out of food if we're honest!
