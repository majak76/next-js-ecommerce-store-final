About the project ðŸ“š
This is an upleveled project where I'm challenged to design and create a full stack ecommerce website using next.js. Main features are:

a products page: where all products are listed
a single product page: so when a product is clicked it goes to this page, the quantity can be edited and the item can be added to the cart
a cart page: that shows all products added to the cart including their quantity (which can be edited), price, a delete button to delete an item from the cart and the total price of all the products in the cart
a checkout page: that shows the total and asks for shipping and payment information
a thank you page: so when the confirm button from the checkout page is clicked, the user gets directed to the thank you page.

















This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
